# Analyzing the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the US
This repository includes replication code for "The Impact of Abortion Bans on Infant Mortality in the US
" (Gemmill et al)

- The data we analyzed was pulled from CDC Wonder and can be found in `data/infant_mortality_data.csv`

## Model fit
You can fit the model by running the python file `run_**.py`. The result of this call is a csv file containing posterior samples.

The following flags can be set at the bottom of this file in the `main` call:
- `cat_name`: One of `total`, `race`, `congenital`, `neonatal`. 
- `num_chains, num_samples, num_warmup`

## Generating results and figures
All model summaries and results are generated by analyzing the posterior samples csv in `R`. 
- `**_figures.qmd` is a Quarto file that generates and saves all figures and tables that appear in the main body of the paper and the paper supplement.
